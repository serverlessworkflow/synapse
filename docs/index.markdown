Synapse is a vendor-neutral, open-source, and community-driven Workflow Management System (WFMS) designed to implement the Serverless Workflow specification.

It enables developers and organizations to define and execute workflows effortlessly using a high-level, intuitive Domain Specific Language (DSL).

With Synapse, you can create powerful workflows that are cloud vendor-agnostic, easily scalable, and highly customizable.
